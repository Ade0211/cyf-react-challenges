# Challenge: "Image Carousel" (React)

## Challenge Overview

Make a React app which allows the user to navigate a set of images (first manually, then with an auto-playing slideshow).

### Try a live demo:

## Difficulty Level

This is an intermediate challenge.

# Level 1 Challenge

Make forward and back buttons to move in that direction through a list of images.

# Level 2 Challenge

Make auto-forward and auto-back buttons to _automatically_ move in that direction through the list of images.

Here's a screenshot example from a completed level 2 challenge.

# Try to finish the rest by yourself

If you want a harder challenge, don't read the rest of this document but instead try to build the app by yourself.

If you want hints, then you will find some below.

# Suggested approach

Here's one approach you might take to building this app.

## Task: Create a new React app

Create a new empty React app for this challenge.

The tool can take a while to run, so continue with the next task while it's running...

## Task: Design your layout _on paper_

Design your layout on paper. Keep it very simple - this is a React challenge, not a CSS challenge.

Use a layout that will be ok on a phone (but _don't_ spend time on responsive design).

Keep this drawing around for reference later.

## Task: Convert your layout to HTML

Convert the drawing to HTML (on codepen or elsewhere) and check the buttons appear correctly.

_DON'T_ add any CSS or extra markup to make it look good just now. That will only make it more difficult for you to think about your app during development.

## Task: Convert your HTML to JSX within your React app

Now make components which will generate the planned HTML from the previous task.

## Task: Make the buttons work

Make your buttons work to navigate forwards and backwards, manually.

## Task: Host your app

Host your app and prove it works by viewing it on your phone!

We recommend you use Netlify. [Instructions are here](https://gist.github.com/nbogie/bf58a391fab6884f77a6adec66047181).

(You can instead use Heroku to host, or github pages, or codesandbox.io, or glitch.com...)

## Task: more buttons - automated slideshow

Add the following buttons:

- auto-forward
- stop
- auto-backwards

These should allow automatic navigation through the images, say every 5 seconds.

## Task: host again.

Host again.

## End of basic challenge!

Congratulations, you've finished the basics!

- Send the URL of your hosted app to your team on Slack.
- Make sure you can access it and play with it on a smartphone!
- Celebrate!

## Optional: Add UI for delay time

Add UI so that the user can specify how long to wait between images.

## Advanced Challenge: make it look good

- Now is a good time to make it look good with CSS, colour, typography, images, and creativity. Maybe you could ask someone to collaborate with you on those aspects.
